# Circle-Physics-Sandbox
2D Circle physics sandbox featuring circle-circle and circle-line collision detection with adjustable gravity.  Resolves both static and dynamic collisions (i.e. non-momentum and momentum conserving collisions).  Default loaded scenario is a waterfall-esque scene with lots of smaller circles.
